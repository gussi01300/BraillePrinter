In this file, We need a typesetting algorithm that arranges Braille on A4-sized paper with three parameters: margins, line spacing, and character spacing.
It can be simplified to filling squares with certain rules in a fixed area.

        Braille Standard Dimensions (Unit: mm)        
===============================================
| Item                                      | Specification |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------+
| Braille dot diameter (mm)                 | 1.2～1.5      |
| Braille dot height (mm)                   | 0.4～0.6      |
| Distance between dots in cell (mm)        | 2.5           |
| Single cell width (mm)                    | 5.0           |
| Single cell height (mm)                   | 7.5           |
| Character spacing (cell center distance, mm) | 6.0        |
| Line spacing (line center distance, mm)   | 10.0          |
| Recommended for body text                 | Diameter 1.2, Height 0.4 |
| Recommended for title/signage             | Diameter 1.5, Height 0.6 |
